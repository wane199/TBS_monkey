This guide will describe how to deploy a shiny application using scripts generated by DNbuilder:

1. Run the shiny app by setting your working directory to the DynNomapp folder, and then run: shiny::runApp() If you are using the RStudio IDE, you can also run it by clicking the Run App button in the editor toolbar after open one of the R scripts.

2. You could modify codes to apply all the necessary changes. Run again to confirm that your application works perfectly.

3. Deploy the application by either clicking on the Publish button in the top right corner of the running app, or use the generated files and deploy it on your server if you host any.

You can find a full guide of how to deploy an application on shinyapp.io server here:
