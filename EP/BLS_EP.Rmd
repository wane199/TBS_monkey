# Abstract
China has about 10 million people with epilepsy[@global;@china].



# Introduction
To develop and validate a radiomics nomogram based on 18F-FDG PET/MRI for individualised seizure prediction after temporal lobe epilepsy surgery.

Approximately half of patients who undergo resective brain surgery for drug-resistant epilepsy have recurrent seizures after surgery[@global]. China has about 10 million people with epilepsy[@global;@china].
Several single predictors have been identified, however, no validated method has been developed to determine a patient's seizure outcome based on their complex clinical characteristics and 18F-FDG PET/MRI radiomics signature[@jehi]. The treatment of medically intractable focal epilepsy involves resection of the brain every year. There are probably thousands of others who would benefit from the procedure, but are not referred for surgery. Due to the unpredictability of seizure outcomes after epilepsy surgery, both groups of patients face difficulties. 

Radiomics is an emerging method for imaging analysis that uses algorithms or statistical tools to determine phenotypic differences between lesions. Using radiomics features, morphology and function can be sensitively evaluated beyond the naked eye and can provide a great deal of additional information.
The radiomics features can provide a great deal of information beyond analysis with the naked eye and can sensitively determine the subtle heterogeneity of the morphology and function on a cellular level, between different parts of the lesions.

The validity of these nomograms in prospective cohort studies could help predict seizure outcomes in patients who are eligible for epilepsy surgery[@extra;@deep].



# Equations

Here is another:
\begin{align}
  AI = c^2.
\end{align}

Inline equations: $\sum_{i = 2}^\infty\{\alpha_i^\beta\}$

# Figures and tables

Figure \ref{fig2} is generated using an R chunk.

```{r fig2, fig.width = 5, fig.height = 5, fig.align='center', out.width="50%", fig.cap = "\\label{fig2}A meaningless scatterplot.", echo = FALSE}
plot(runif(25), runif(25))
```

# Tables coming from R

Tables can also be generated using R chunks, as shown in Table \ref{tab1} for example.

```{r tab1, echo = TRUE}
knitr::kable(head(mtcars)[,1:4], 
    caption = "\\label{tab1}Caption centered above table"
)
```
