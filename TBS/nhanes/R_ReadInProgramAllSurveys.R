# ** PUBLIC-USE LINKED MORTALITY FOLLOW-UP THROUGH DECEMBER 31, 2019 **
#
# The following R code can be used to read the fixed-width format ASCII public-use Linked
# Mortality Files (LMFs) from a stored location into a R data frame.  Basic frequencies
# are also produced.  
# 
# NOTE:   With the exception of linkage eligibility-status (ELIGSTAT), the other discrete
#         variables (e.g., MORTSTAT) are designated as integers. We provide the definitions
#         of the variable values in the comments but leave it up to the user to decide 
#         whether integer or factor variables is/are preferred for their analyses.  
#
# NOTE:   As some variables are survey specific, we have created two versions of the program: 
#         one for NHIS and another for NHANES.
# 
# *****************************************************************************************   
#
# NOTE:   To download and save the public-use LMFs to your hard-drive, follow these steps:
# 
# (1)     Designate a folder on your hard-drive to download the public-use LMF.  In this example,
#         the data will be saved to "C:\PUBLIC USE DATA\".
#
# (2)     To download the public-use LMF, go to the website:  
#         https://ftp.cdc.gov/pub/Health_Statistics/NCHS/datalinkage/linked_mortality/
#
#         Right-click on the desired survey link and select "Save target as...".  A "Save As"
#         screen will appear where you will need to select and input a location where to
#         save the data file on your hard drive.  
#
#         Also note that the "Save as type:" box should read "DAT File (*.dat)".  This will ensure
#         that the data file is saved to your hard drive in the correct format.  
#
#         In this example, the data file is saved in the folder, "C:\PUBLIC USE DATA\", and the 
#         data file is saved as "<SURVEYNAME>_MORT_2019_PUBLIC.DAT". 
#
# *****************************************************************************************   
#
# R NOTES:
# (1)     For convenience, the user can place the name of the public-use LMF they are reading
#         in and creating as a R data frame in just two places: (1) the line beginning with
#         srvyin; and (2) the line beginning with srvyout. The resulting R data frame
#         will have the shorthand name assigned in the srvyout line.   
#
# (2)     Variable labels are not provided. Please see the public-use LMF codebook for 
#         this information.
#
# (3)     Variable value formats are not attached to the variables. The value formats, 
#         however, are included in comment blocks in the Variable Frequencies section.
#
